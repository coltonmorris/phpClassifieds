==============

cs2450 classified project done in php, we are using ataxicdesign.com/test as our root folder

db_functions is where functions that use the database should be added/editted.

session is hopefully where all session variables are declared, but I don't think I've stayed true to that standard.

Idealy, a cookie.php page would be made, which is where all cookies are created. 
This would be nice to keep code clean, except I don't know if declaring all cookies in the same file is smart or achievable.
