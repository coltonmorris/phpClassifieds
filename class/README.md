db_functions is where functions that use the database should be added/editted.

session is hopefully where all session variables are declared, but I don't think I've stayed true to that standard.

Idealy, a cookie.php page would be made, which is where all cookies are created. This would be nice to keep code clean, except I don't know if declaring all cookies in the same file is smart or achievable.
