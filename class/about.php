    This website was developed by a small team of DSUSA Students at the request of Gregory 
    Layton, the Student Body President for the 2014-2015 academic year. This site is to aid students that are 
    hurting for money by allowing them to sell things they do need and to buy things at lower costs. The site 
    was mainly made for textbooks, but we encourage you to sell anything else as well. <br><br>
    <span class="tab"></span>The site is reserved for Dixie State University Students, so only email addresses containing 
    "dmail.dixie.edu" will be allowed to register. All posts are private to the outside world, only Dixie 
    
    Students and the admins may view them. Please note that this site does not condone the sale of any 
    
    illegal items or firearms. We will remove any posts containing items that may get somebody in trouble. <br><br>
    
    <span class="tab"></span>We take your privacy seriously, so every post will only have a lifetime of four months before it is 
    
    deleted forever. We will also not store any of your personal information except for your email address. 
    
    You may however include your personal info in the post, but we will not make any guarantees of privacy 
    
    if it is posted. If you get harassed, delete your post and contact the Dean of Students.<br><br> 
    
    <span class="tab"></span>This site was developed by Alex, Anthie, Colton, and Tyler. Alex will continue to develop it after 
    
    the initial launch and any feature requests should be sent to plambson@dmail.dixie.edu
